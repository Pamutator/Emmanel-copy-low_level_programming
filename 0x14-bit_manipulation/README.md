## Tasks

### [0](0-binary_to_uint.c)
- Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
- where b is pointing to a string of 0 and 1 chars
- __Return:__ the converted number, or 0 if
there is one or more chars in the string b that is not 0 or 1
- b is NULL

### [1](1-print_binary.c)
- Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.
- not allowed to use arrays
- not allowed to use malloc
- not allowed to use the % or / operators

### [10](2-get_bit.c)
- Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
- where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to get
- __Returns:__ the value of the bit at index index or -1 if an error occured

### [11](3-set_bit.c)
- Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
- where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to set
- __Returns:__ 1 if it worked, or -1 if an error occurred

### [100](4-clear_bit.c)
- Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
- where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to set
- __Returns:__ 1 if it worked, or -1 if an error occurred

### [101](5-flip_bits.c)
- Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
- not allowed to use the % or / operators

### [Endianness](100-get_endianness.c)
- Write a function that checks the endianness.
- __Returns:__ 0 if big endian, 1 if little endian

### [Crackme3](101-password)
- Find the password for this program.
- Save the password in the file 101-password
